<!-- The game consists of a series of lights and sounds.
The game unit will randomly generate a sequence of lights by lighting up different colored pads.
The player's objective is to repeat the sequence of lights by pressing the colored pads in the same order.
The sequence will start with a single light, and with each successful repetition, an additional light will be added to the sequence.
The player must remember and reproduce the entire sequence correctly to continue to the next level.
If the player makes a mistake and presses the wrong pad or presses the pads in the wrong order, the game will end. -->
